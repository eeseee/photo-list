# PhotoList

##Overview
A simple web app that fetches /photos JSON data from [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays
them in a horizontal scrollable list. Photos are downloaded to cache so that if app is terminated, the next session won't refetch already cached data. Also has a button that randomizes the order in which the photos are displayed.
